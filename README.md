ARDroneSDK3
===============

**Welcome to the Software Development Kit for Parrot Drones.**

It can be used to write applications which control the latest generation of Parrot Drones:
- Disco
- Bebop Drone
- Bebop 2
- Mambo
- Swing
- Rolling Spider
- Airborne Night
- Airborne Cargo
- Hydrofoil
- Jumping Sumo
- Jumping Night
- Jumping Race
- Skycontroller
- SkyController 2

<br>
  
The SDK provides the source code you need to do everything provided by the freeflight 3 application:
- discover the drones on the network
- connect the drones
- send piloting and camera commands
- configure the drones
- get informations (depends on drones capabilities)
- get H264 video stream on bebop
- get MJpeg video stream on Jumping Sumo
- transfer Photos / videos
- update the drones
- handle Drone Academy / Mavlink files
- and everything which pops out of your mind

<br>

**The easiest way to control a drone is to create a device controller thanks to the [libARController](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/libARController)**. Samples which use this new API are available : [iOS Sample](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/iOS/SDKSample), [Android Sample](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/Android), [JumpingSumoSample](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/Unix/JumpingSumoSample) and [BebopSample](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/Unix/BebopSample) for Unix.

It's BSD license allows to use, change, distribute with no restriction.
Contributions and new feature discussions are highly appreciated.
